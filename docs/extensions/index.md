# Extensions Catalog

Catalog of CleanArchitecture.Extensions packages. Each page follows the extension template (overview, when to use, compat, install, usage, troubleshooting, samples/tests).

- Start with Core (guards, results, logging, clocks, pipeline behaviors), then Multitenancy Core; add more pages as packages land.
- Keep compat tables up to date with template/.NET/package versions.
