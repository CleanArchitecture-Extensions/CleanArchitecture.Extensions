# Contributing

Guidance for code and docs contributions.

## Principles
- Mirror Jason Taylor's Clean Architecture conventions.
- Keep extensions opt-in with minimal required config.
- Update docs when behavior changes.

## Workflow
1. Fork/branch and make changes inside CleanArchitecture.Extensions/ solution.
2. Add/adjust docs alongside code changes.
3. Run tests relevant to the change (TBD as test suites grow).
4. For docs: pip install -r docs/requirements.txt && mkdocs serve for local preview.

## Style (docs)
- Follow the templates in the documentation strategy.
- Keep snippets concise and prefer includes from source when possible.
