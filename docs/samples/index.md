# Samples

There are no runnable samples in the repository yet. The current guidance is:

- Use the extension pages for step-by-step setup.
- Review tests under `tests/` for realistic usage patterns.

Planned samples:

- Query caching with explicit invalidation.
- Multitenancy resolution (header + route) with enforcement.
- EF Core shared-database isolation with tenant filters.
