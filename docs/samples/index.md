# Samples

Runnable samples to demonstrate extensions in real projects.

- Located under samples/ in the repo.
- Each sample should include setup instructions and expected output.
- Use scripts to reset/run samples for consistent results.

## Planned samples
- Minimal API with one extension enabled.
- Multitenant API with tenant resolution strategies.
- Observability-enabled API (metrics/tracing/logging) once adapters are added.
